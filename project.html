                here are screenshots of the pages on my website, which was made for a class assignment.
                On the left is the homepage, and on 
                the right is my bio. My homepage is where you can access more info on my projects. It will
                hopefully get updated in the future when I have more to show. My bio is where you can read 
                a little about my myself and my work experience. It's also where you can find some links
                to contact me.
